```
UI Center is meant to house various implementations of complex UI challenges/ideas 

```


## List of Challenges Next

```
- [x] sponsive Table with API data (Geller99/tables.git)
- [ ] Case sensitive Auto-fill suggestion box 
- [ ] Search Engine Interface: Blog
- [ ] Select-Text pop-up editor: Blog
- [ ] Select-Text note-taker: Blog
- [ ] Nested Modals with Routing for Login/Signup Form
- [ ] Like, Subscribe, Follow system : StreamHelix
- [ ] Snapshot State: Redux
- [x] Article Page Component : Blog
- [ ] Overlay Modals
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] Dynamic Mini-map with color tracker scroll nodes : Chrome extension?
- [x] User Authentication Login System
- [ ] Drag and Drop User-Interface -Â  UI component Lib
- [ ] Scheduling interface with data shaped from/for API (eg - when you make an event in a calendar, and you want to be able to have it recur on certain days or weeks etc. This was HARD btw) -
- [ ] Logic builder - let the user build out how another user should progress through an interface. For example, let the admin user select "If user.gender === female AND user.meta.lastMenstruation.date === Now().date - 25, then: recommend iron supplements and chocolate" (the hardest part of this was nested logic rules - for example, letting them select that the then branch would occur if: Rule 1 AND Rule B OR Rule C. -
- [ ]  Info modal pop up populating from API - for example, you're looking at your API table list view, and you want to get more details about an item, so you click the little More Info button, and it sends the uid of the row to the API, which returns what you need to fill out your modal. Easy, but it took some thinking - like, allow the user to close the modal before the data loads, and cancel the request if they do!
